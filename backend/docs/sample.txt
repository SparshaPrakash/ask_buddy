FastAPI is a modern and high-performance Python web framework used to build APIs quickly and easily. It automatically generates interactive API documentation using OpenAPI and Swagger UI.

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify building applications that use large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for chaining multiple LLM calls, integrating with external data sources, and managing conversation history.

LangChain supports key features like memory, which allows the model to remember previous parts of a conversation, and retrieval, which lets the model fetch relevant pieces of information from a knowledge base.

LangChain can work with many LLM providers, such as OpenAI's GPT models, Hugging Face models, or local models like LLaMA running through Ollama.

LangChain also provides Agents, which let LLMs decide which tools to use and in what order to solve a problem.

It supports advanced features like:
- Prompt templates to manage dynamic prompts.
- Chains that combine multiple steps of processing.
- Tool integration to call APIs or run Python code during a conversation.

By combining these, you can build intelligent assistants that do much more than simple Q&A.

Ollama is a local runtime that lets you run powerful open-source models such as LLaMA 3 and Mistral directly on your own computer without sending data to external servers.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of asking the model to answer from scratch, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and gives that context to the model.

Using RAG with LangChain and Ollama allows you to build a chatbot that answers questions using your own documents, while also maintaining conversation history.

You can add more documents to the knowledge base, and the chatbot will automatically learn to answer questions using that additional context.

FastAPI, combined with LangChain and Ollama, makes it easy to build a local AI-powered application that can handle two-way conversations, remember context, and retrieve accurate answers.
